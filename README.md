# FLFMapper - Fixed Length File Mapper
The FLFMapper project is designed to provide mapping capabilities between Fixed Length Files & POJOs.
Annotations are used to provide an easy way for developers to quickly alter an existing class that can then be 
parsed into a fixed length file or vice versa.
